Remove unused database tables and update code

This commit:
1. Removes the following tables from the database:
   - ingredients
   - product_ingredients
   - environmental_impact
   - product_alternatives
   - price_history
   - product_errors
   - product_nutrition

2. Updates the codebase to handle the removal of these tables:
   - Removes the ingredients router and endpoints
   - Updates the product router to not reference ingredients
   - Modifies helper functions to calculate values on-the-fly
   - Simplifies data models

The data from these tables has been backed up before removal in 
tables with the _backup_20240430 suffix.

These changes simplify the database schema and reduce maintenance
overhead while preserving core functionality.

BREAKING CHANGE: The /api/v1/ingredients endpoint is no longer available.
