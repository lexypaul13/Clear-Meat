<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ingredient and Nutrition Data:</strong> When you scan a barcode, we process the product’s ingredient and nutritional information but do not collect or store any personal data about you.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics (optional):</strong> If analytics are enabled, we collect anonymized usage metrics to improve app functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>We generate ingredient risk classifications, nutritional context, and safer product alternatives solely from scanned product data.</li>
<li>Analytics data (if collected) is used only to improve app performance and features and is not linked to individual users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>No user data is shared with third parties. Any analytics services we use collect anonymized data and comply with privacy standards.</p>

<p>Scanivore is not intended for children under 13 years of age. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13, we will delete such data immediately.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
