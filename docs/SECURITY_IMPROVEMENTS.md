# Security Improvements - Sensitive Key Protection

## Summary
This document outlines the security improvements made to prevent exposure of sensitive API keys and credentials in logs, console output, and debug information.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Server Startup Scripts
**Files:** `start_server.sh`, `scripts/startup/start_local_dev.sh`

**Before:** 
- `SUPABASE_KEY` showed first 8-10 characters: `eyJhbGci...`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` showed first 8 characters: `eyJhbGci...`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` showed first 8 characters: `AIzaSyB...`

**After:**
- All sensitive keys now show: `****HIDDEN****`

### 2. Application Logging
**Files:** `app/core/supabase.py`, `app/db/supabase_client.py`

**Before:**
- Logged partial key information: `"anon key (first 4 chars): eyJh"`
- Logged response headers that might contain sensitive data

**After:**
- Removed all key fragment logging
- Removed response header logging to prevent echo exposure

### 3. Environment Setup Scripts
**File:** `scripts/setup_env.py`

**Before:**
- Showed first 8 characters of all keys during validation

**After:**
- Variables containing `KEY` or `SECRET` show `****HIDDEN****`
- Non-sensitive variables still show partial values for validation

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. No Partial Key Display
- Never show any portion of API keys, even partial
- Keys are either fully hidden or not shown at all

### 2. Response Header Protection
- HTTP response headers are not logged in debug mode
- Prevents accidental exposure of echoed credentials

### 3. Environment Variable Masking
- Automatic detection of sensitive variables by name pattern
- Variables containing `KEY`, `SECRET`, `TOKEN`, `PASSWORD` are hidden

### 4. Consistent Security Across All Scripts
- Startup scripts, setup tools, and application code all follow same security standards
- No accidental exposure through different code paths

## Files Modified

1. `start_server.sh` - Main server startup script
2. `scripts/startup/start_local_dev.sh` - Development startup script  
3. `scripts/setup_env.py` - Environment validation tool
4. `app/core/supabase.py` - Core Supabase client initialization
5. `app/db/supabase_client.py` - Database client with connection testing

## Verification

To verify these changes are working:

1. **Start the server:** `./start_server.sh`
2. **Check logs:** Look for `****HIDDEN****` instead of partial keys
3. **Run setup:** `python scripts/setup_env.py` - sensitive vars should be masked
4. **Debug mode:** Even with `DEBUG=true`, no keys should appear in logs

## Remaining Security Considerations

### Non-Critical Exposures (Acceptable)
- SUPABASE_URL is still shown (not a secret, needed for debugging)
- Host and port information (not sensitive)
- Boolean flags indicating if keys are set (no actual key data)

### Secure Test Scripts
- Test scripts that use keys do so securely without logging them
- `secure_test.sh` extracts keys from Supabase status command securely

## Impact

✅ **Zero sensitive key exposure** in console output
✅ **Zero sensitive key exposure** in application logs  
✅ **Zero sensitive key exposure** in debug information
✅ **Consistent security** across all scripts and applications
✅ **Maintained functionality** - all features work normally

These changes ensure that sensitive credentials are never accidentally exposed through logs, console output, or debug information while maintaining full application functionality.
