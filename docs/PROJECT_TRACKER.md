```
User
├── id (PK)
├── email, full_name
├── is_active, is_superuser, role
└── relationships:
    ├── ScanHistory (one-to-many)
    └── UserFavorite (one-to-many)

Product
├── code (PK)
├── name, brand, description
├── nutritional info (calories, protein, etc.)
├── meat details (type, nitrites, etc.)
├── risk_rating, risk_score
└── relationships:
    ├── ProductIngredient (one-to-many)
    ├── ProductAlternative (one-to-many)
    ├── ScanHistory (one-to-many)
    └── UserFavorite (one-to-many)

Ingredient
├── id (PK)
├── name, description, category
├── risk_level, concerns
└── relationships:
    └── ProductIngredient (one-to-many)

ProductIngredient
├── product_code (PK, FK)
├── ingredient_id (PK, FK)
└── position

ProductAlternative
├── product_code (PK, FK)
├── alternative_code (PK, FK)
├── similarity_score
└── reason

ScanHistory
├── id (PK)
├── user_id (FK)
├── product_code (FK)
├── scanned_at
└── location, device_info

UserFavorite
├── user_id (PK, FK)
├── product_code (PK, FK)
├── added_at
└── notes
```

**Key Relationships:**
1. **User to ScanHistory**: One-to-many. A user can scan many products.
2. **User to UserFavorite**: One-to-many. A user can have many favorite products.
3. **Product to ProductIngredient**: One-to-many. A product can contain many ingredients.
4. **Ingredient to ProductIngredient**: One-to-many. An ingredient can be in many products.
5. **Product to ProductAlternative**: One-to-many. A product can have many alternative suggestions.
6. **Product to ScanHistory**: One-to-many. A product can be scanned multiple times.
7. **Product to UserFavorite**: One-to-many. A product can be favorited by multiple users.
