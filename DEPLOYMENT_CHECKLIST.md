## üöÄ Infrastructure Checklist

### Server Configuration
- [ ] Python 3.10+ is installed
- [ ] Virtual environment is set up
- [ ] All dependencies are installed from `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Server has adequate resources (CPU, RAM, Storage)
- [ ] Firewall rules are configured

### SSL/TLS
- [ ] HTTPS is configured (either via proxy or directly)
- [ ] SSL certificates are valid and auto-renewing
- [ ] HTTP is redirected to HTTPS
- [ ] Security headers are configured

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Application logs are configured
- [ ] Error tracking is set up (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Performance monitoring is enabled
- [ ] Health check endpoint is monitored
- [ ] Alerts are configured for critical issues

## üì¶ Deployment Process

### Pre-deployment
1. [ ] Run all tests: `pytest`
2. [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities: `pip audit`
3. [ ] Review environment configuration
4. [ ] Test database migrations
5. [ ] Verify all API endpoints work

### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Back up the database
2. [ ] Set environment to production: `ENVIRONMENT=production`
3. [ ] Apply database migrations
4. [ ] Deploy application code
5. [ ] Restart application servers
6. [ ] Verify deployment with health checks

### Post-deployment
1. [ ] Monitor application logs for errors
2. [ ] Check performance metrics
3. [ ] Verify all endpoints are responding
4. [ ] Test critical user flows
5. [ ] Monitor for any security alerts

## üîß Configuration Files

### Required Files
- [ ] `.env` with production values (never commit this)
- [ ] `requirements.txt` is up to date
- [ ] Database migration files are current

### Optional but Recommended
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment
- [ ] Reverse proxy configuration (nginx/Apache)
- [ ] Systemd service file for process management
- [ ] Log rotation configuration

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Caching
- [ ] Redis is configured for caching
- [ ] Cache TTLs are appropriate
- [ ] Cache invalidation is working

### Database
- [ ] All performance indexes are applied
- [ ] Query performance is monitored
- [ ] Connection pooling is configured

### AI Services
- [ ] Batch processing is enabled
- [ ] Request queuing is configured
- [ ] Fallback strategies are in place

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Plan
1. [ ] Previous version is tagged and accessible
2. [ ] Database rollback scripts are ready
3. [ ] Quick rollback procedure is documented
4. [ ] Team knows how to execute rollback

### Incident Response
1. [ ] On-call schedule is defined
2. [ ] Escalation procedures are documented
3. [ ] Access to production systems is controlled
4. [ ] Incident response runbooks are available

## üìù Final Checks

- [ ] All items above are checked and verified
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] Team is trained on deployment procedures
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are tested
- [ ] Security audit has been performed
