# API Endpoint Removal Documentation

## Current API Status

### Products API
- **Read-Only Endpoints (Available):**
  - `GET /products/` - List all products with optional filtering
  - `GET /products/{code}` - Get detailed information about a specific product
  - `GET /products/{code}/alternatives` - Get alternative products for a specific product
  
- **Removed Endpoints:**
  - `PUT /products/{code}` - Update a product
  - `DELETE /products/{code}` - Delete a product
  - `GET /products/{code}/contribution` - Get product contribution information
  - `POST /products/{code}/report` - Report a problem with a product (removed to make API completely read-only)

### Ingredients API
- **Read-Only Endpoints (Available):**
  - `GET /ingredients/` - List all ingredients
  - `GET /ingredients/{ingredient_id}` - Get detailed information about a specific ingredient

- **Removed Endpoints:**
  - `POST /ingredients/` - Create a new ingredient
  - `PUT /ingredients/{ingredient_id}` - Update an ingredient
  - `DELETE /ingredients/{ingredient_id}` - Delete an ingredient

## Server Configuration with Supabase

### Required Dependencies
- `python-multipart` - Required for form handling in FastAPI

### Supabase Integration
No changes are required to the Supabase configuration. The changes only affect the API endpoints, not the database access layer. Supabase will continue to operate as the backend database service with all tables intact.

## Potential Issues and Considerations

### Data Management
1. **Completely Read-Only API**: The API is now completely read-only for both products and ingredients. This means no data can be created, updated, or deleted through the API directly.

2. **Data Maintenance**: Without write endpoints, database maintenance must be performed through other means:
   - Supabase Dashboard for manual data management
   - Direct SQL queries to the Supabase database
   - Custom admin tools outside the public API

### Client Applications
1. **Client Code Updates**: Any client applications using the removed endpoints (including the product report endpoint) will need to be updated to function correctly with the modified API.

2. **Error Handling**: Clients might expect these endpoints to exist, so they should be updated to handle 404 errors appropriately if they attempt to call these endpoints.

### Documentation
1. **API Documentation**: API documentation has been updated to remove references to the deleted endpoints.

2. **Test Scripts**: Test scripts have been modified to only test the remaining endpoints.

### Versioning
1. **API Versioning**: If this is a significant change, consider implementing proper API versioning to maintain backward compatibility (e.g., v1, v2).

### Future Considerations
1. **Administrative Interface**: Consider creating a separate administrative API or interface for data management that uses Supabase directly.

2. **Bulk Operations**: For data management efficiency, consider implementing bulk import/export capabilities through alternative means.

3. **Data Integrity**: Ensure database integrity is maintained even without API-based update/delete operations.

4. **Customer Feedback**: Consider implementing an alternative mechanism for collecting product problem reports outside of the API.

## Implementation Notes
1. Endpoint implementations were removed from router files:
   - `app/routers/products.py` - removed update, delete, contribution, and report endpoints
   - `app/routers/ingredients.py` - removed create, update, and delete endpoints

2. Documentation was updated in:
   - `API_README.md`
   - `API_CHANGES.md`

3. Test scripts were updated to only test available endpoints:
   - `tests/simple_product_test.py`
   - `tests/simple_ingredient_test.py`
